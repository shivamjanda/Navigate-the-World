# Navigate-the-World

Objective: A company (Navigate the World) recently went through an IPO (Initial Public
Offering) to raise money for an exciting new alternative to Google Maps, Waze, and Bing Maps.
The company offered one million common shares, and one hundred thousand preferred shares.
The company sold eight hundred thousand common shares, and eight thousand of its preferred
shares within forty-eight hours of offering its shares. Common shares were sold for 42 dollars a
share, and preferred shares were sold for 100 dollars a share. What is the difference? Common
shares were sold to the public on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), while preferred shares
were sold to high profile investors to raise awareness. Preferred shares also give the owner 10
times more voting power within the company (e.g., if 1 common share is equal to 1 vote, then 1
preferred share is equal to 10 votes). Preferred shares also guarantee a dividend of 5 dollars a
share at the end of the year. The problem that Navigate the World is running into, is keeping
track of the owners of the current shares, the number of shares available, the price that a share
was sold for (share prices fluctuate). They are asking you to create a piece of software that will
help them manage this mess!
